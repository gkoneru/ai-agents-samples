This sample showcases a notebook-based walkthrough of how to integrate **Databricks Genie** with **Azure AI Foundry Agent**, and how to enhance the agent's functionality by adding external tools such as Logic Apps.

## Files

- `adb-aifoundry.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook demonstrating the integration between Logic Apps and Genie agent as tool extension
- `streamlit_chat_app.py` - Streamlit web app for a simple, interactive chat interface with the agent
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Features

- Integration between Azure AI Foundry and Databricks Genie
- Extendable agent with tools like `send_email` and `get_weather` (powered by Logic Apps)
